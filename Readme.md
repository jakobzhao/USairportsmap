## A Web-Map of Airports in the United States

This map shows airports in the the United States and if they have a control tower or not. Airport data is collected from a shapefile from [Data.Gov][]. US-States boundary data is acquired from [Mike Bostock][] of [D3][]. An interactive element is added to each location with information on the city and state in which the airport is located. 

Clicking on the bottom left interactive square will open a window that shows coordinates as you move the mouse across the screen, incorporated by [leaflet.coordinates][]
